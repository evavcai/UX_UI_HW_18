                    <h2>Hello! My name is Eva.</h2>
                    <p>I’m a UX designer based in Austin, TX. As an undergraduate at Rice University majoring in cognitive science and psychology, I was taught to extract qualitative insights from large amounts of quantitative data to understand human cognition. I want to utilize my knowledge of human thought processes to identify individual pain points and develop solutions that can change people’s lives.</p>
                    <p>After interning for a decentralized finance startup company in 2021, I realized that the world’s future financial system lies in blockchain technologies. My number one priority for designing on a system that many are skeptical about is to convey a sense of trust. Through using a user-centered design approach, my goal is to generate solutions that empower users to feel confident about their financial decisions.</p>
                    <p>I truly believe research and design can bridge the gap between everyday users and seemingly complex blockchain technologies.</p>
